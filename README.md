# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What did you build? 

We made an iOS app using Swift and SwiftUI. The app displays information and images for various global landmarks, and users can navigate between places via map. 

Include some screenshots.

## Who Did What?

We worked on the tutorial together. Nina did the setup with `Location.swift` and `Locations.swift` and also added the flashcard and capital functionality via `Card.swift` and  `CardView.swift`. Matthew added the map functionality via  `WorldView.swift` and added the tips with `Tip.swift` and `TipsView.swift`.

## What you learned

Cool things that worked: 
* Built in apple maps functionality is super easy (especially compared to Google maps API)
* Built in iOS icons are cool and easy to use 
* Good understanding of Swift views, navigation, and layout 

Didn't work: 
* Few concepts that don't make total sense, for example:
  * We don't fully understand the difference between a `struct` and a `class`
  * We don't understand the purpose of having `static let example` variables within `struct` definitions
